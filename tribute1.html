            <p>When asked about the person I admire in the universe, I do not
                require to look at celebrities or any other big influential
                names in society. When it comes to me, the person I admire most
                in the world is <span style="font-size:25px"><b>My Mother</b></span>.

                We all have people whom we consider to be highly inspirational
                and influential to look upon, and in my case, my mother is an
                excellent example of these characters.</p>
            
            <h2>Her Admirable Qualities.... </h2>
            <!-- Some content related to topic -->
            <ul>
                <li> One thing I most admire about my mother for is her
                    strength, which
                    appears to be resistant throughout hard times. I hold great
                    admiration
                    for my mother because of her determination, how she never
                    backs
                    down, and the way she stands up for what she believes in no
                    matter
                    the hardships that come along.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My mother has a striking appearance, but behind this, she is
                    very
                    alluring, admirable, and kind. At first, one can conclude
                    that she
                    is a blunt and cold person because of her quiet nature, but
                    after
                    knowing her, she turns out to be a friendly, warm-hearted,
                    gentle,
                    and generous person.
                </li>
                <li>
                    My mother has been a dedicated individual in
                    the society through volunteering in church during weekends
                    and
                    holidays as well as helping in the local homeless shelters.
                    Kindness
                    is crucial and healthy since one takes pride in caring for
                    others
                    since they need caring, and it gives people a pleasant
                    feeling
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thanks to my mother, I have grown to be a
                    kind-hearted and deeply-caring person since I believe that
                    it's upon
                    me to help those in need whenever I am capable.
